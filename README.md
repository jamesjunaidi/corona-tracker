# corona tracker
 python script to track growth of corona virus spread
 Right now how it works is that the data.txt file has the number of corona cases
 starting from Feb. 24 up to Mar. 24 (today)
 I will try to keep that text file updated as needed so we can continue to use the data
 The dates are hard coded, it will not work if you just add another date onto the data txt file
 Need to increase the index of the initializer of the dates.
